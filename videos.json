    "description": "N HAIR SETUP Tool is a technical utility for creating dynamic curve setups in Maya, designed to automate and standardise the creation of dynamic curve simulations in a production environment. It eliminates tedious and error-prone manual node construction, significantly reducing common setup issues in complex workflows.\n\nDuring the creation stage, the tool generates a fully deterministic, pipeline-compliant dynamic curve setup, consistently applying strict naming conventions and structural standards. This improves artist efficiency while enhancing simulation stability and predictability. The resulting setups are reliable, repeatable, and scalable across shots, assets, and large-scale productions, supporting robust CFX pipelines.",
